                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                    TravelWise was founded in 2023 by a group of friends who shared a common love for travel and culture. We were inspired by our own experiences of travelling around the world and learning about different places and people. We wanted to create a website that would help others do the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We started with a simple idea: to make a list of 625 words that would help anyone learn the basics of any language. We believed that learning a new language was the key to unlocking the secrets of a new culture and making the most of any trip. We also wanted to make learning fun and easy, so we used images instead of translations to teach the words.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We posted our list on our blog and social media, and we were amazed by the response. People loved our idea and wanted to learn more. We realized that we had something valuable to offer, and we decided to expand our website and our vision.
                </p>
                <h2>
